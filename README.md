# F1-data-analysis-final
An analysis of Formula 1 data using R, specifically comparing race stats between Red Bull and Mercedes from 2005 to 2021. This data was found on TidyTuesday (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2021/2021-09-07/readme.md) under 2021. However, the data was uploaded in September that year, so the data for the 2021 season is incomplete. However, the data still shows how Red Bull closed the gap to Mercedes over the years to eventually win the 2021 Driver's Championship, bringing an end to Mercedes 8-year long domination in Formula 1.

Results: 

In the first plot titled, "Number of Podiums Per Season", you can see how successful Mercedes was from 2014 to 2021. In F1, getting a podium finish (1st, 2nd, 3rd place) is very good because it means the team and driver gains a significant number of points in the championship. While Red Bull struggled during the first few years into Mercedes reign over F1, they regained their footing in 2016 and began to close the points gap between the two teams. You can also see when Mercedes began to drop in podiums from 2019 to 2021. 

In the second plot titled, "Average Race Finishing Position: Red Bull vs Mercedes", you can again see the gap between Red Bull and Mercedes close over the years. While Mercedes on average had 1st place finishes from 2014 to 2020, the average dropped in 2021 to match Red Bull's average of 1st and 2nd place, which they had jumped up to from an average of 3rd place finishes in previous years.

In the third plot titled, "Year vs. Constructor Wins", you can see a visual of how many races each team won over the years. While the number of Mercedes wins slightly declines in the years leading up to 2021, Red Bull wins increase significantly from 2020 to 2021 to surpass the number of Mercedes wins.
